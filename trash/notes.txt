Based on thenewboston's redux tutorial  https://github.com/Ivan5646/redux_boston/blob/master

index.js -> 
actions/index.js (by default all actions are sent to reducers/index.js) ->
reducers/index.js 

containers (are imported in components) -> components

actions/index.js (is imported to, and assigned to onCLick for <li>) ->  container/user-list.js

data (everything that is in reducers) has been passed to the Store through allReducers in main index.js


Event handling.
1) Entry point: onClick event is assigned in containers/user-list.js with the name of the action (the action is the callback that passed to onClick).
2) Triggers the action in actions.
3) The action is sent to reducers and the engaged reducer is giving the new part of state.


Fetching data from server structure, not sure if it is the right way
root index.js has const middleware = [ thunk ] (I don't know what the f it does) ->

trying to figutre out fetching process
1) in actions/index.js in fetchPostsWithRedux() (with the help of other functions) is written functionality to fetch the data 
2) in containers/posts.js fetchPostsWithRedux() is called inside componentDidMount()
3) The action is sent to reducers/reducer-posts.js ... FETCH_SUCCESS happens and it updates the state
