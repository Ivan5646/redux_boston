the app structure
Based on thenewboston's redux tutorial  https://github.com/Ivan5646/redux_boston/blob/master

index.js -> 
actions/index.js (by default all actions are sent to reducers/index.js) ->
reducers/index.js 

containers (are imported in components) -> components

actions/index.js (is imported to, and assigned to onCLick for <li>) ->  container/user-list.js

data (everything that is in redusers)has been passed to the Store through allReducers in main index.js


Event handling.
1) Entry point: onClick event is assigned in containers/user-list.js with the name of the action.
2) Triggers the action in actions.
3) The action is sent to reducers and the engaged reducer is giving the new part of state.
