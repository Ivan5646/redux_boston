 Redux — A complimentary library to React that provides a way to easily keep the data(State) and the events(Actions).

Redux Terms: “Actions” And “States”
Every component does two things:
1. Render DOM based on some data. This data is called as a “state”.
2. Listen to the user and other events and send them to JS functions. These are called “Actions”.
